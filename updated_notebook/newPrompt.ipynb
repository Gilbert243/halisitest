        "ORIGIN OF OUR BLACK CASTOR OIL:\n",
        "Haiti, a small island in the Caribbean, is home to rich natural treasures. It all begins in Eva’s grandparents’ backyard, in the village of Piton. In this lush environment, the family prepares a unique recipe based on castor seeds. These seeds come from the castor bean plant (Ricinus communis), from which a precious vegetable oil is extracted: Haitian Black Castor Oil. Known locally as “Lwil Maskriti” in Haitian Creole, or “Huile de Carapate” in French Antilles, this oil is produced using a traditional ancestral method.\n",
        "\n",
        "The castor seeds are roasted, then ground and boiled in water until a rich amber-colored oil with a roasted hazelnut scent is obtained. This process preserves omega 3, 6, and 9 fatty acids, vitamin E, and ricinoleic acid — making it a unique oil worldwide.\n",
        "\n",
        "HISTORY OF OUR HAITIAN BLACK CASTOR OIL:\n",
        "The founder’s grandfather was the first to produce the oil when Eva began receiving her first online orders through her YouTube videos. He helped produce the oil in larger quantities to meet demand. Though he has since passed, Eva honors his memory and legacy within EvasHair.\n",
        "\n",
        "Message from Eva Biassou-André:\n",
        "“From where you are, thank you so much, Grandpa, for believing in us and leaving EvasHair as your legacy.”\n",
        "\n",
        "HOW OUR OIL IS PRODUCED TODAY:\n",
        "Initially handcrafted by Eva’s grandfather and a small team, production has since expanded through cooperatives in Haitian provinces such as Léogâne, Kenscoff, Petit-Goâve, and Côteaux. This traditional yet scaled-up process sustains around 70 Haitian families. The business model encourages rural employment, helping reduce urban migration as more youth return to the provinces to work in oil production.\n",
        "\n",
        "BENEFITS OF HAITIAN BLACK CASTOR OIL:\n",
        "• Stimulates hair growth and thickening (scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and nails)\n",
        "• Strengthens and coats the hair fiber\n",
        "• Locks in moisture for long-lasting hydration\n",
        "• Repairs dry, brittle, and damaged hair\n",
        "• Protects and fortifies fragile curls and coils\n",
        "\n",
        "HOW TO USE:\n",
        "1. To promote growth and thickness:\n",
        "   Apply a pistachio-sized amount to a clean, dry scalp and massage until fully absorbed.\n",
        "   Recommended twice per week. Can also be applied to eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and nails.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. To retain moisture:\n",
        "   Work section by section on clean hair. Apply slightly less than a teaspoon of oil after hydrating with water or cream. This seals in moisture.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. As a hot oil or deep treatment:\n",
        "   Apply 3–5 tablespoons of oil to the hair, leave on for 45 minutes under a heating cap, then shampoo and apply a moisturizing conditioner or mask.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. As a massage oil:\n",
        "   Warm the desired amount in a water bath, then massage until absorbed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. For beard care:\n",
        "   Apply 2 drops daily, massage and comb. Promotes faster, thicker beard growth.\n",
